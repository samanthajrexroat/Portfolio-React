                      <p>
                              A former educator with nine years of experience, I am an aspiring web developer looking for a position where I can best utilize my organizational skills, passion for growth and positive attitude. 
                      I believe that diligence and effective communication are critical to a prosperous work environment, and that positive relationships build strong teams. 
                      With previous experience across various fields, I have gained flexibility, knowledge and problem solving skills. As a vocalist and musician, I am committed to persistence and mastery. 
                      I look forward to utilizing these skills to help a company grow.
